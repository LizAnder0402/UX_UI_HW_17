                <h1>The possibilities of design excite me. I want to use UX/UI to design experiences that help people navigate life better.
                </h1>
                <p>I have always been creative and got interested in digital art in high school. Since then, I have completed several courses in graphic design through WSU Lake Campus and ultimately earned a certificate of UX/UI through OSU and EdEx.

                    I bring art to the UX/UI process. I especially love storytelling and doing work that does good for people.
